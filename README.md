JBoss BOMs
==========

The JBoss BOM's project provides Maven BOM files enhancing Jave EE 6 with deployment and test tooling. These files manage the version of the dependencies you use in your project, ensuring you always get a compatible stack.

Usage
-----

To use the BOM, import into your dependency management. For example, if you wanted "Java EE with Tools recommended by JBoss", use:

    <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
	    <dependency>
	       <groupId>org.jboss.spec</groupId>
               <artifactId>jboss-javaee-web-6.0-with-tools</artifactId>
               <version>1.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
               <scope>import</scope>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement> 
	
Unfortunately, Maven doesn't allow you to specify plugin versions this way. The readme for each BOM calls out any plugin versions you should use. For example, to use the plugins associated with "Java EE with Tools recommended by JBoss":

    <pluginManagement>
        <plugins>
            <!-- The Maven Surefire plugin tests your application. Here we ensure we are using a version compatible with Arquillian -->
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.10</version>
            </plugin>
            <!-- The JBoss AS plugin deploys your war to a local JBoss AS container -->
            <!-- To use, set the JBOSS_HOME environment variable and run:
                 mvn package jboss-as:deploy -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.jboss.as.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>jboss-as-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>7.1.1.Final</version>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>

You'll need to take a look at the POM source in order to find the latest versions of plugins recommended.

Use cases
---------

A number of BOMs are provided, each of which address a specific use case. If your usage falls into a number of use cases, simply use all of the relevant BOMs.

### jboss-javaee-6.0-with-errai: Java EE with Errai and GWT

Errai provides a comprehensive framework and tools for building rich web applications, leveraging the GWT compiler. With standard server-side APIs, such as CDI, in the browser, managing large web applications was never so easy. This BOM adds both Errai and GWT to your project.

### jboss-javaee-6.0-with-hibernate: Java EE with Hibernate

Historically, Hibernate facilitated the storage and retrieval of Java domain objects via Object/Relational Mapping.  Today, Hibernate is a collection of related projects enabling developers to utilize POJO-style domain models in their applications in ways extending well beyond Object/Relational Mapping.

This BOM builds on the Java EE full profile BOM, adding Hibernate Community projects including Hibernate ORM, Hibernate Search and Hibernate Validator. It also provides tool projects such as Hibernate JPA Model Gen and Hibernate Validator Annotation Processor.

### jboss-javaee-6.0-with-tools: Java EE with tools recommended by JBoss

Java EE lacks any testing APIs, and for this reason JBoss developed the Arquillian project, along with it's various component projects, such as Arquillian Drone, and the sister project Shrinkwrap. This BOM builds on the Java EE full profile BOM, adding Arquillian to the mix. It also provides a version of JUnit and TestNG recommended for use with Arquillian.
 
Furthermore, this BOM adds the JBoss AS Maven deployment plugin. EAP 6's recommended mode of deployment is via the management APIs, and the Maven plugin is the recommended way to do this, if the customer is using Maven for building.

### jboss-javaee-6.0-with-transactions: Java EE with JBoss Transactionss


JBoss AS includes a world class transaction manager. In order to access it's full capabilites, including for example XTS, WS-AT and WS-BA, you need to use the JBossTS APIs. 

This BOM adds the JBossTS APIs to the stack.
